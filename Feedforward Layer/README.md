#### Basic Structure of Neural Networks

1)Perceptron:

Takes multiple binary inputs 𝑥1,𝑥2,… and gives a binary output (0 or 1).

Output is determined by:

Weights 𝑤𝑗 determine the importance of inputs, and bias replaces the threshold.

2)Sigmoid Neurons: Improve over perceptrons by producing outputs in the range [0,1] and enabling smoother learning through gradual changes.
